Data visualization is about turning data into pictures or graphs to help us understand it better. It's like translating numbers and facts into visuals that show patterns, trends, and outliers. With charts, graphs, and maps, it makes complex information easier to see and helps us make smarter decisions based on what we find. Good data visualization is clear, simple, and relevant, making it easier for everyone to grasp and use the insights hidden in the data.

I've created a dynamic dashboard in Power BI using the Bird Strike dataset, showcasing insightful visualizations of bird strike incidents. Through interactive charts and graphs, the dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of wildlife strikes over time, their impact on flight operations, and key factors such as altitude, aircraft make/model, and phase of flight.

By visually representing the data, the dashboard enables users to easily identify trends, patterns, and high-risk areas, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions and implement effective mitigation strategies to enhance aviation safety.
