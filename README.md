Data visualization is about turning data into pictures or graphs to help us understand it better. It's like translating numbers and facts into visuals that show patterns, trends, and outliers. With charts, graphs, and maps, it makes complex information easier to see and helps us make smarter decisions based on what we find. Good data visualization is clear, simple, and relevant, making it easier for everyone to grasp and use the insights hidden in the data.
